# ETHBogota Submission: Account Abstraction with Social Recovery

## Disclaimer

Currently, the social recovery wallet has simple functions

- Set guardians
- Set threshold

However, some of the possible functions for better security and UX are not implemented in this hackathon due to lack of time.
The followings are examples.

- Adding timelock for the execution for preventing a malicious attack from the guardian
- Adding/Removing the guardian
